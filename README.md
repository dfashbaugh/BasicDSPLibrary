# BasicDSPLibrary

This is a library of basic DSP functions intended to be used to create various filters. Primarily intended to be used with embedded systems as an Arduino library. This is in active use reducing noise on joystick and potentiometer inputs.

## Filter Builders

This implements some simple libraries that let users build FIR and IIR filters by just inputting coefficients.
